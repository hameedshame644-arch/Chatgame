# Chatgame
ChatGame is a real‑time chatroom app with a justice‑system twist. Users join themed rooms (American, Indian, etc.), earn badges, and roles like Admin, Warden, Judge, Lawyer, CIA Agent. Moderation flows through prison, bail, and courtrooms, making community discipline transparent, fair, and gamified.
