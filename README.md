# 🏛️ ChatGame

**ChatGame** is a real-time chatroom application built around a unique justice-system moderation model. Inspired by law and order, ChatGame replaces traditional mute/ban features with gamified systems like prison, courtrooms, bail, and hidden intelligence rooms. Users earn badges, take on roles, and participate in a structured digital society.
